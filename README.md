This project was created for ENG006 at University of California, Davis. It is a dice based, two player GUI game. The game is created using MATLAB. The objective of the game is to battle with your friend and win. Player one will be dog charceter and player two will be assigned snake. Player having bigger number in each roll gets to perform action of choice.

<h2>My contribution</h2>

I was involved with writing the code for the playing of different sound files that could play on a situational basis (ex: dice rolling and winner determination), the functionality of the winner button, the GUI, the offline behaviour of the game and the modification of the callback button functions to extend to the other playersâ€™ columns on the scorecard. Aside from the core contributions of the winner button and button callbacks for each player, I added in a background for the game. I worked extensively on the core of the app, which pertains to the GUI of the game for the players to interact with. My contributions for the core include the dice rolling button, outcome display and randomization of the dice when rolled, total score display for each player.
